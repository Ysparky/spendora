# Environment Configuration

This project uses environment variables for configuration, particularly for Firebase services.

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Fill in the actual values in the `.env` file:

   ```
   # Firebase Configuration

   # Android
   FIREBASE_ANDROID_API_KEY=your_android_api_key
   FIREBASE_ANDROID_APP_ID=your_android_app_id
   ...
   ```

3. These values can be found in your Firebase console or in the `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` files generated by the Firebase CLI.

## Security

The `.env` file contains sensitive information and is excluded from version control.
Never commit your `.env` file to git. Only `.env.example` with placeholder values should be committed.
